# Implementation Notes

Running log of implementation work in this repo. Updated while a plan is being carried out;
see `CLAUDE.md` §11 for the policy.

## Deviations

Log entries here when an edge case forces a deviation from an agreed plan. Format:

```
### <date> — <short title>
- Planned: <what the plan said>
- Did instead: <the conservative option taken>
- Why: <the edge case that forced it>
```

### 2026-07-12 — session-report marker rewound to df1d9bb
- Planned: after publishing the first session report, write current `HEAD` into
  `.claude/.session-report-marker`.
- Did instead: wrote `df1d9bb` (the merge commit) rather than `HEAD`.
- Why: `HEAD` moved to `f15daac` (bindless vertex-pulling draw path) mid-session from a
  parallel session/worktree. That commit was not covered by the published report, so
  marking `HEAD` would have made the next `/session-report` silently skip it. Rewinding
  the marker to the last reported state is the conservative option: worst case the next
  report re-describes a commit, never drops one.
